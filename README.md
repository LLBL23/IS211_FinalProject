# Final Project
<hr>
A blog web application written using Flask and Bootstrap.


## Features 
<hr>

### Interface
I adopted the Codemy Flask Tutorial for the back-end and front-end development of the blog app making modifications to the layout and functionality. 

Upon starting the app the user is taken to the index page (homepage) which displays a list of available blogs, listed in reverse chronological order.
From there the user can register to the site which then gives them access to more options on the site.

### Registration, Login, and Dashboard Display

Upon clicking registration in the navigation bar, the user is taken to the registration page where they are instructed to enter their registration information.
After submitting the information, the user is informed that registration was successful.

After registering, the user can click on "Login" in the navigation bar to login and access the other features of the site. Upon successful login, the user is taken to their dashboard page where they can add a new post (a new post cab also be added by clicking "Add a Blog Post" in the navigation bar). After submitting a new post, the user is taken bask to the homepage where all posts are listed.

Once a user has posted a blog the dashboard page will list the title of all of their blogs with the option to edit or delete the post allows the user to edit or delete the post.

## Conclusion
<hr>

An issue encountered when working on this project is that the alert messages displayed when using the web application do not close after clicking the "x". 
I don't have much experience with full-stack web development, but with the use of Flask and Bootstrap, the process was less difficult than I initially expected and I look forward to utilizing them more in the future.
